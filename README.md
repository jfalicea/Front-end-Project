=======
### Description
Amemezing News fetches 2 APIs. The goal of this project is to enjoy memes without the judgemental eyes of co-workers, parents, and/or teachers. When the user enters the website, random memes will display. The user will have the option to read an article by clicking the icon on the top-right navigation bar. Once the user clicks on the icon, a full page will display a list of articles. The page acts as a screen block for hiding the meme.
