=======

Amemezing News fetches 2 APIs. When users enters the website, they will see random memes and have the option to read an article by clicking the icon on the top-right navigation bar. Once you click on the icon, a full page will pop up with a list of articles. The page also acts as a screen block for hiding the meme.
